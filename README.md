# Sequence Analysis

This analysis shows the changing tunisian political elite after and before the revolution in 2011.

The data, which is publicly available, was taken from Wikipedia, Wikileaks and https://majles.marsad.tn/2014/

Back in 2016, project was one of my first analysis done in R, before I've only worked in Stata and SPSS. For this reason, the actual script is very sloppy, but everything works.
